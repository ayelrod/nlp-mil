## Preface
This project was part of [Lodewijk Brand's](http://minds.mines.edu/people/lou/) (Lou) research project that I assisted with for a few months. I got this opportunity to assist Lou's work through the [Google Hidden Talents](https://cs.mines.edu/hiddentalents/) program at the Colorado School of Mines.

## About The Project
Lou is working on developing a machine learning model for Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL). You can learn more about MIL [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_instance_learning). At the time of writing this, Lou's ML algorithm is not open source yet.

The tasks that I did mainly included parsing datasets to make them compatible with Lou's algorithm. I also got the chance to explore different feature extraction methods for natural language processing and I tried to find the best one for Lou's algorithm.
